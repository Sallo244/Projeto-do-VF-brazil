 BRA_amor:0 "'Amor'"
 BRA_amor_desc:0 "Love - supreme principle through which a nation and her people guide their actions - must be present in all of our interactions. There is love in unity, brotherhood. Family. Who better to command this national family than a great father, fostering all his children through the struggles of the new century, as many before him have done?"
 BRA_formalizar_o_patrianovismo_na_ilegalidade:0 "Formalize the Patrianovist Movement"
 BRA_formalizar_o_patrianovismo_na_ilegalidade_desc:0 "The Patrianovist moviment - translated literally to "New-Fatherlandism" - is an monarchist organization in close ideological proximity to the tenets of Integralism. In terms of the possibility of an Imperial Restoration, it represents Brazil's best shot. Like most political organizations, it has been banned by the new constitution, but this doesn't mean it can't still operate."
 BRA_negociar_com_os_integralistas:0 "Bring in the Integralists"
 BRA_negociar_com_os_integralistas_desc:0 "Vargas' Coup has left all parties in disarray. With Plínio's Ministry a distant dream, we can harness our influence with the Afro-Brazilian and Northeastern communities to convince the Integralists that unifying our efforts and turning their "Organic Republic" into an Empire is their best shot at survival."
 BRA_oexercitodecaxias:0 "The Army of Caxias"
 BRA_oexercitodecaxias_desc:0 "The Brazilian Army was the main actor during the coup that exiled Emperor Pedro II in 1889. Many members of the armed forces, including then Marshal Deodoro himself, came to regret the unfoldings of November the 15th. By re-linking the Brazilian Army's patron, Caxias, to his loyal service to the Emperor, we can surely shake their faith in the Republican institutions."
 BRA_memoriasdalibertadora:0 "Memoirs of the Liberator"
 BRA_memoriasdalibertadora_desc:0 "In 1888 Princess Isabel, daughter of Pedro II, signed in law the absolute prohibition of slavery. For that, she and her family are well-loved by Brazil's black community.

 BRA_ocismadamaconaria:0 "On Freemasonry"
 BRA_ocismadamaconaria_desc:0 "While Freemasonry and her acolytes have been publicaly shunned and despised by the Catholic community world-wide, Brazilian Freemasonry had the personal approval of our monarchs.

 BRA_restaurar_o_padroado:0 "Restore the 'Padroado'"
 BRA_restaurar_o_padroado_desc:0 "The support of Freemasonry nationally-wide would mean a direct affront to the Church, but this doesn't mean we are prone to instating a secular empire. Catholicism, while conductor of our citizens morals and ethics, will only not influence the Emperor's. To that avail, we'll restore the Padroado system, through which the Moderative Power regulates the Church's operation in our country."
 BRA_opactodesaocristovao:0 "The Pact of Saint Christopher"
 BRA_opactodesaocristovao_desc:0 "The banishment of Freemasonry nationally-wide is a radical, yet necessary, manouver. Now that the possibility of their betrayal yet again of the Emperor is addressed, we'll need the Church's support more than ever. The Pact of St. Christopher, to be sealed in the Palace of St. Christopher, would solidify the church's position and their role into assisting the Imperial state."
 BRA_parlamentarismoabrasileira:0 "Our Parliamentarianism"
 BRA_parlamentarismoabrasileira_desc:0 "Brazil too big, too diverse and too proud to succumb to the temptations of tyranny. The maintainance of Provincial Legislative Assemblies, the autonomy of the parliament to pass constitutional changes and the regional control of the National Guard - through the imposition of the Aditional Act of 1834 - will have it so all of Brazil keeps itself whole without our baby-sitting." 
 BRA_oimperioorganico:0 "The Organic Empire"
 BRA_oimperioorganico_desc:0 "The union of all races and peoples - driven by the ever-increasing wish for national prosperity and glory - has no space for regional politics and political manouvers.

 BRA_arestauracao:0 "The Restoration"
 BRA_arestauracao_desc:0 "The army, the big politicians, the integralist militias, the blacks, the poor, the whites, the rich. All Brazilians, all servants of His Majesty. These Brazilians, empowered by the national renovation, will consolidate the birth of the Third Brazilian Empire."

Repeating the feat in our major cities will surely make the people aware of the ANL's intent."
 BRA_orevoodasgalinhasverdes:0 "Skewer the Green Hens"
 BRA_orevoodasgalinhasverdes_desc:0 "The Green Hens, as we have come to call the Integralists, are violently opposing the people's triumph in Brazil. To ensure the ultimate victory of the coalition, we must harass and boycott all integralist meetings and marches!"

 BRA_a_2a_intentona_comunista_desc:0 "We've strenghened our grip in the lower echelons of the army, made the populace aware of our intents and neutralized the fascist threat. Now, only one enemy remains. We will end what we started in 35."
 BRA_o_xadrez_de_vargas:0 "Vargas' Chess"
 BRA_o_xadrez_de_vargas_desc:0 "While Vargas position has been safeguarded through the National Security Law, we can't rely on our Integralist generals, Communist soldiers and Liberal politicians solely.

 BRA_o_estado_novo:0 "The 'Estado Novo'"
 BRA_o_estado_novo_desc:0 "A central state, in its complete wisefullness, is capable of providing the general well being of its citizens and prosperity for its entrepreneurs.

 BRA_departamento_de_imprensa_e_propaganda_desc:0 "Our rival's needless querels have resulted in fruitfull opportunities for the New State to fortify itself.

 BRA_non_dvcor_dvco_desc:0 "While the National Security Law's enforcement has been a major blow to our relations with Vargas' provisory government, and the Polaca even worse, it's not time to yield. A compromise with the Fascists and a gathering of legalist officers will keep us bind and strong enough to combat Vargas."
 BRA_manifesto_mineiro:0 "The Mineiros' Manifesto"
 BRA_manifesto_mineiro_desc:0 "While Minas Gerais surprisingly backed Vargas in the Civil War, her industrials and politicians are disgruntled with Vargas's dismantling of their influence. A Manifesto against his actions will surely be welcome in our struggle against his tyranny."
 BRA_golpe_de_dutra:0 "Dutra's Coup"
 BRA_golpe_de_dutra_desc:0 "Marshal Eurico Gaspar Dutra is the informal leader of the Brazilian Army, held with regard by most officers and previously a strong backer of Vargas's cause. Now, faced against tyranny and opposition, Dutra favours democracy, and has agreed to "gently ask" Vargas to fly back to his farm in São Borja."
 BRA_formalizaraacao:0 "Formalize the Action"
 BRA_formalizaraacao_desc:0 "Through Vargas' National Security Law, the ANL and the PCB became illegal. The immense political backlash left national politics in disarray. While the AIB is already a popular titan, we can expand her to incorporate most anti-Vargas conservative agrarian politicians, streghening fascism's influence over the government."
 BRA_oministeriodeplinio:0 "Plínio's Ministry"
 BRA_oministeriodeplinio_desc:0 "Now that we've united the right under the Sigma, Plínio Salgado's claim over the Ministry of Education became much more significant. Through this position, we can start having more direct influence over presidental affairs, and shift the youth in our favor."
 BRA_o_levante_integralista:0 "The Integralist Levant"
 BRA_o_levante_integralista_desc:0 "As we conceded and expanded, Integralism became a force to be reckoned with. Now Vargas stands alone, making himself an enemy of the left and our officers' puppet. The Catete is within our grasp."
 
 BRA_brasilia:0 "Brasília"
 BRA_brasilia_desc:0 "Moving the capital to the interior was one of the national objectives since the Empire of Pedro II. Not only would it be interesting in the matter of national security, ensuring that it could not be the capital subject to naval invasions, but also as a guarantee of the development of the interior. Let us now begin the construction of this new capital."
 BRA_tirodeguerra:0 "'Tiro de Guerra'"

 BRA_expandir_os_magistrados_desc:0 "Brazil's ultratraditional magistratures are a piece of old, Portuguese, bureocracy.

 BRA_colegiospolitecnicos:0 "Politechnical Colleges"
 BRA_colegiospolitecnicos_desc:0 "The proposed unification and organization of a federal universities system can only be justified with the expasion of most campii.
