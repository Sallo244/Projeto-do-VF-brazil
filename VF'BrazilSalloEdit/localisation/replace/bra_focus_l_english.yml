 bra_quereismo_desc:0 "While Vargas position has been safeguarded through the National Security Law, we can't rely on our Integralist generals, Communist soldiers and Liberal politicians solely. By plotting these groups against each other - dividing and conquering - we can pacefully and safefully stripe them away from influence."
 bra_regionalism_desc:0 "While the National Security Law's enforcement has been a major blow to our relations with Vargas' provisory government, and the Polaca even worse, it's not time to yield. A compromise with the Fascists and a gathering of legalist officers will keep us bind and strong enough to combat Vargas."

 bra_modernizacao_marinha_desc:0 "While I'd be correct to argue that the army is, in the current day, the most important branch of the armed forces, Brazil held a strong naval tradition during the times of the Empire, diplomatically useful most often than not.

 bra_cmsp_desc:0 "The now-Metropolitan São Paulo is powered by the labour of her foreign immigrants.

 bra_amigo_eua_desc:0 "Of all things considered, the Americans are gentle overlords. They've consistently protected all of the Americans from other powers - albeit not frequently from themselves. Be it out of genuine innocence or complacency, strenghtening our relationship with Washington may attract a lot of money."
 bra_amigo_eua_tooltip:0 "If the Democratic United States is in the Allies, Brazil will ask the United Kingdom to join. If the Loyalists are in power and have a faction, Brazil will directly join the US's faction."

 bra_amigo_uk_desc:0 "If history has taught us anything, is that empires eventually fall. We even have a close example of that. Be it as it may, we don't know when - or if - the sun will ever set on the British Empire. In either case, there's still a lot of tan to get."
 bra_amigo_urss:0 "A Second USSR"
 bra_amigo_urss_desc:0 "The Soviet Union and us aren't very different from each other. Well, we are quite different, but in the good way."
 bra_amigo_alemanha:0 "The Principle of Authority"
 bra_amigo_alemanha_desc:0 "The German cause is strong. Their powerful armies, genius scientists and powerful ideology shook the world like never previously seen before. Not to mention we'd heavily benefit from changes in the global order. Besides, we definitely don't want to die."

 bra_sem_eixo_desc:0 "Since the days of the Empire Brazil doesn't fight in a continental war. Not a major one, in any case. Our newly-renewed vigour and nationalism have surely remembered us of that, and achieve our destiny of stretching from the Caribbean into the Prata we will."
 bra_basta:0 "Enough!"
 bra_basta_desc:0 "We will no longer stand the crises, the coups, the limitation of industrial development throught importations, the exploration of our natural resources, of trans-continental oppression and diplomatic arrogance. It's enough!"
 bra_entreguismo:0 "'Entreguismo'"
 bra_entreguismo_desc:0 "Entreguismo - a Portuguese neologism for 'an ideology of giving stuff away' - is a pejorative term for nationalists of all ideologies to attack more liberal brazilians that are against the nationalization of all Brazilian oil. Pejorative as it may be, allowing foreigners to tap into our reserves of all resources might have its benefits."

 bra_heal_wounds:0 "Participate in Global Politics"
 bra_heal_wounds_desc:0 "If Brazil is to achieve its long dream of becoming an international power, we must integrate ourselves into the international markets and politics, participate in trans-atlantic wars and act as a power-to-be."
 bra_guide_latam:0 "The Crux"
 bra_guide_latam_desc:0 "If Brazil is to achieve its long dream of becoming an international power, we must do so deservingly. Be it by integrating the continent through diplomacy or force, Brazil will shine the light of the Global South, and emerge from it as its leader and great power."
 
 bra_monarquia_2_focus:0 "Formalize the Patrianovist Movement"
 bra_monarquia_2_focus_desc:0 "The Patrianovist moviment - translated literally to "New-Fatherlandism" - is an monarchist organization in close ideological proximity to the tenets of Integralism. In terms of the possibility of an Imperial Restoration, it represents Brazil's best shot. Like most political organizations, it has been banned by the new constitution, but this doesn't mean it can't still operate."
 bra_patri_1_focus:0 "Bring in the Integralists"
 bra_patri_1_focus_desc:0 "Vargas' Coup has left all parties in disarray. With Plínio's Ministry a distant dream, we can harness our influence with the Afro-Brazilian and Northeastern communities to convince the Integralists that unifying our efforts and turning their "Organic Republic" into an Empire is their best shot at survival."
 bra_patri_2_focus:0 "The Army of Caxias"
 bra_patri_2_focus_desc:0 "The Brazilian Army was the main actor during the coup that exiled Emperor Pedro II in 1889. Many members of the armed forces, including then Marshal Deodoro himself, came to regret the unfoldings of November the 15th. By re-linking the Brazilian Army's patron, Caxias, to his loyal service to the Emperor, we can surely shake their faith in the Republican institutions."
 bra_patri_3_focus:0 "Memoirs of the Liberator"
 bra_patri_3_focus_desc:0 "In 1888 Princess Isabel, daughter of Pedro II, signed in law the absolute prohibition of slavery. For that, she and her family are well-loved by Brazil's black community. Most of her admirers are still in the fields and away from the cities, far from Vargas' populism's reach, and ever closer to supporting our cause."
 bra_patri_4_focus:0 "On Freemasonry"
 bra_patri_4_focus_desc:0 "While Freemasonry and her acolytes have been publicaly shunned and despised by the Catholic community world-wide, Brazilian Freemasonry had the personal approval of our monarchs. It's up to the moviment and to the future emperor himself as to whether or not they'll be allowed to operate in the third empire."
 bra_patri_5_focus:0 "Restore the 'Padroado'"
 bra_patri_5_focus_desc:0 "The support of Freemasonry nationally-wide would mean a direct affront to the Church, but this doesn't mean we are prone to instating a secular empire. Catholicism, while conductor of our citizens morals and ethics, will only not influence the Emperor's. To that avail, we'll restore the Padroado system, through which the Moderative Power regulates the Church's operation in our country."
 bra_patri_6_focus:0 "The Pact of Saint Christopher"
 bra_patri_6_focus_desc:0 "The banishment of Freemasonry nationally-wide is a radical, yet necessary, manouver. Now that the possibility of their betrayal yet again of the Emperor is addressed, we'll need the Church's support more than ever. The Pact of St. Christopher, to be sealed in the Palace of St. Christopher, would solidify the church's position and their role into assisting the Imperial state."
 bra_patri_7_focus:0 "Our Parliamentarianism"
 bra_patri_7_focus_desc:0 "Brazil too big, too diverse and too proud to succumb to the temptations of tyranny. The maintainance of Provincial Legislative Assemblies, the autonomy of the parliament to pass constitutional changes and the regional control of the National Guard - through the imposition of the Aditional Act of 1834 - will have it so all of Brazil keeps itself whole without our baby-sitting." 
 bra_patri_8_focus:0 "The Organic Empire"
 bra_patri_8_focus_desc:0 "The union of all races and peoples - driven by the ever-increasing wish for national prosperity and glory - has no space for regional politics and political manouvers. The empowerment of the Moderative Power, materialized by the re-interpretation of the Interpretative Law of 1840, will assure the Emperor has complete control over the national guard and provincial administration."
 bra_patri_9_focus:0 "The Restoration"
 bra_patri_9_focus_desc:0 "The army, the big politicians, the integralist militias, the blacks, the poor, the whites, the rich. All Brazilians, all servants of His Majesty. These Brazilians, empowered by the national renovation, will consolidate the birth of the Third Brazilian Empire."

 continuous_bra_politicagem_desc:0 "The uniquely Brazilian expression is the routine of crony politics of the Iberian World: for the state to syphon resources with the sole purpose of perpetuating its own existance. While this might be generally regarded as bad, an ambitious leader might need a lot of political power to get the job done, and might find so by dedicating his cabinet's time into exclusively dealing with other politicians."
