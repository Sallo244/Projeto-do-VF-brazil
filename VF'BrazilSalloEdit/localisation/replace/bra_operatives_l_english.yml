With some unaware of the presence and performance of others, thus generating an effective control by the central office, which will gather the information and reports brought by the two groups of agents."

 upgrade_celulas_department_desc:0 "Regional agencies act in a similar way to the central agency, but with information at the regional level. With information collection at this level being decentralized, the 'Asymmetric Cells Department' coordinates activities centrally, absorbing information from all offices and agencies, cataloging it, processing it, separating reports from information, and sending to the competent offices for later use, or archiving."
