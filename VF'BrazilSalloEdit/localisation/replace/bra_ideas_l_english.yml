 bra_armed_forces_lagged_desc:0 "Despite the existence of coercive and military forces installed here in Colonial Brazil by our Portuguese metropolis and the constitution of a military corps subject to the general government, our Army has been symbolically operational since 1648 (Battle of the Guararapes), being used again in the form of Imperial Army , to break up insurrections, and participations against the expansionism of our neighbors, as in 1864 - 1870, (War of Paraguay), however being composed, by slaves, indigenous and poorly trained young people. It is precisely this military “presence” in our 20th century political process that will shape a series of events linked to the military industrial complex, related to this research."
